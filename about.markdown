# About me
I'm a 23 year old recent CS grad from UBC Okanagan. It's the year 2024, when I'm writing this, and things are pretty crazy. 
I love reading about businesses, playing video-games and thinking of projects to embark on.

I have big dreams and ambitions for myself. But for now, I'm focusing on consistent self-progress.

My current priorities/goals are to finish The Odin Project, build projects and refresh myself on CS fundamentals such as OOP and Data Structures + Algo.
So you can expect the next few posts to be all about that.
