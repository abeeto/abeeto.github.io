# Becoming a better developer
Hey I'm deciding to build a blog to act as a way to log my progress and share my learning journey to the online world.
Mostly for myself. I recently read a post about "Learning In Public (LIP)" by [https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public]swyx.io who really reaffirmed my desire to share what I'm learning.

Now I don't actually expect a single person to stumble onto this page. Would be awesome, but the internet is a big place and I'm just one of billions sitting in front of a laptop. But, my hope is that by dumping out my own learnings and synthesising all the info I get, I can become a better developer faster. 

Plus, it would be nice to have something to look back to and think, "Wow, that guy was pretty dumb right?".

I hope this blog will be a great place to document my journey, the positives, the negatives, and so on.
My aim is for this blog to sort of encapsulate me, so while, most posts will be about coding/technology, I hope some can also be a way to showcase my *personality*.

The next few posts will likely be about what I've been learning in web development. I've been following The Odin Project (it's great btw) and have been learning a lot more than I had anticipated. I made the mistakes of jumping too early into using a framework and I'll be delving into why I found a return to the basics to be very helpful.

That's all for now, see ya.
