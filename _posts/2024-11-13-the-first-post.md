# Becoming a better developer
Hey I'm deciding to build a blog to hopefully act as a way to log my progress to become a better developer. 
I hope this blog will be a great place to document my journey, the positives, the negatives, and so on.
My aim is for this blog to sort of encapsulate me, so while, most posts will be about coding/technology, I hope some can also be a way to showcase my *personality*. 

# About me
I'm a 23 year old recent CS grad from UBC Okanagan. It's the year 2024, when I'm writing this, and things are pretty crazy. 
I love reading about businesses, playing video-games and thinking of projects to embark on.

I have big dreams and ambitions for myself. But for now, I'm focusing on consistent self-progress.

My current priorities/goals are to finish The Odin Project, build projects and refresh myself on CS fundamentals such as OOP and Data Structures + Algo.
So you can expect the next few posts to be all about that.
