# Becoming a better developer
Hey I'm deciding to build a blog to hopefully act as a way to log my progress to become a better developer. 
I hope this blog will be a great place to document my journey, the positives, the negatives, and so on.
My aim is for this blog to sort of encapsulate me, so while, most posts will be about coding/technology, I hope some can also be a way to showcase my *personality*.
